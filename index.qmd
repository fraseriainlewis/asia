This site contains a collection of R vignettes covering a range of themes relevant to statisticians working in drug development and clinical research. While we hope these vignettes are a useful resource, they are provided 'as is' without warranty of any kind, express or implied and used at your own risk.   

## Key Themes and Topics

-  **Tensorflow Probability**

[Tensorflow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) is a relatively new library for Bayesian modelling building on the Tensorflow computational framework for large scale computation. An alternative to [RStan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/) and removes reliance on a single library for business critical modelling 

-  **Graphical Neural Networks**

[Graphical Neural Networks](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2024/02/graph-neural-networks-in-tensorflow.html) (GNN) are new tools and the go-to option for modelling in certain drug discovery tasks, such as properties of new molecules. This is a general methodology with wide application across clinical research for prediction and clustering. 

-  **LLM prompts for statistical work**

Large language models are changing the way statisticians work. Effectively using LLMs is a skill on its own, especially how to design and iterate prompts to LLMs save effort overall.
